### Accommodation in the Netherlands

While your IND application is being processed, securing accommodation is essential. Here are some helpful resources to assist you in finding a place to stay:

#### Websites to Find Accommodation:
1. **Kamernet**: [https://kamernet.nl/](https://kamernet.nl/)
2. **Facebook Groups**: Search for rental groups that are specific to the Netherlands.

#### Tips for Finding Accommodation:
- **High Demand Areas**: Cities like **Rotterdam** and **Amsterdam** often experience housing shortages, so it is crucial to apply as soon as you find a listing.
- **Landlord Interviews**: Be prepared to attend interviews or phone calls with potential landlords.
- **Shared Housing**: Consider opting for shared accommodation (e.g., shared apartments) instead of a full apartment, as this increases your chances of securing a place.
- **Management Companies**: Some landlords work with property management companies, such as [365 Beheer](https://365beheer.nl/), to streamline the rental process.

#### Signing the Rental Contract:
- **Signing**: Once you find suitable accommodation, you'll need to sign the rental contract and return it via email.
- **Payments**: Invoices for rent will be sent monthly, and either you or your employer will be responsible for making the payments.

#### Additional Considerations:
- **Employment-Based Rentals**: Some landlords may prefer tenants who are working, so having an employment visa could make you a more desirable tenant compared to students.
- **Proximity to Work**: Choose a place that is close to your workplace to save time and reduce commuting costs.
- **Virtual Tours**: Use services like [Rotterdam Apartments](https://rotterdamapartments.com/) to take virtual tours or authorized in-person tours if you're not currently in the Netherlands.
- **BSN Requirement**: To obtain your BSN (Dutch Social Security Number) for visa extensions, you will need a valid rental contract.
