### Bank Account Options for Non-Dutch Nationals

Opening a bank account in the Netherlands can be tricky, as banks typically require certain documentation, which can vary based on your nationality. However, there are a few banks that accept customers from a wide range of countries, including Iran. Below are some options that might suit your needs:

#### 1. **Revolut**
   - Revolut is a digital banking platform that works with multiple nationalities, including Iranian citizens.
   - You can open an account remotely, and no BSN (Dutch Social Security Number) is required for the first 90 days.
   - After 90 days, a BSN will be needed to continue using the account.
   - In the meantime, a valid residence permit should suffice.
   - Revolut allows you to manage multiple currencies and offers cryptocurrency services as well.

#### 2. **Bunq**
   - Bunq is a Dutch bank that allows you to open an account entirely remotely, no matter your nationality.
   - The requirement for BSN is similar to Revolut. You can open the account initially without a BSN, but it may be required later for full account access.

#### 3. **ING**
   - ING, a major Dutch bank, also you can open accounts remotely, including individuals from Iran(with residence permit).
   - A BSN is required to complete the registration process.
