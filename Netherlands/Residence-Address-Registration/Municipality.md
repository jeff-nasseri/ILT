### Registering Your Residence at the Municipality in Rotterdam

Upon your arrival in the Netherlands, it is crucial to register your residence address with the **Municipality of Rotterdam**. To complete this process, bring the following documents with you:

1. **House Contract**: Proof of your accommodation.
2. **Translated Birth Certificate**: This must be translated into Dutch or English and legalized with Dutch embassy confirmation. If you don't have this confirmation at the time of registration, the municipality will typically allow you a 6-month period to provide it without any extra charges. For non-HSM migrants, the municipality usually charges a fee of â‚¬300, but HSM migrants are exempt.
3. **Residence Permit Card**: The card you received from the IND.
4. **Passport**: Your valid passport.
5. **Completed Registration Form**: The "First registration in the Municipal Personal Records Database" form, which can be found online or on the municipality's website.

Please note that the location of the municipality may vary depending on the city in which you reside.

### After Registration

Once you have completed the registration process, the municipality will send a letter to your registered address. This letter will contain your **Citizen Service Number (BSN)**, which is essential for various administrative tasks in the Netherlands. You will need to keep this number for future reference.

Additionally, your address will be registered in the **BRP (Personal Records Database)**, which is an official government database. You can find more information about the BRP [here](https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/personal-records-database-brp).

The confirmation letter should arrive within **2 to 4 weeks** after your registration at the municipality.
