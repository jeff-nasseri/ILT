### DigiD - Digital Identity in the Netherlands

DigiD is the Dutch government's digital identity system, functioning similarly to Single Sign-On (SSO). For more information on SSO, you can refer to this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on).

The purpose of DigiD is to allow you to register using your BSN (Dutch Social Security Number) and then log in to various government websites securely. Once registered, you can use DigiD to access services on government-related websites, much like using "login with Google" or "login with Facebook" on other platforms, but specifically for Dutch government sites.

#### Registration Process:
1. **First-Time Registration**: When registering for the first time, you'll need to provide your personal details, residence permit, and address information.
2. **Approval Code**: After filling in your details on the website, you wonâ€™t be able to complete the registration immediately. The system will send a letter to your address with an approval code.
3. **Finalizing Registration**: To complete the registration, you will need to enter this approval code from the letter. The letter will be sent to your address as soon as you finish the online registration process.
