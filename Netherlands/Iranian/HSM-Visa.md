### How It Works:
1. **Contract with Employor**: If your employer is not listed in the IND sponsorship list, they will contract with Employor.
2. **Employor as Sponsor**: Employor will act as your official sponsor and sign a contract with you.
3. **Support and Transition**: Employor will provide support until your original company is ready to sponsor you directly.

3. **Legal Process**: Employor will submit the application to the IND.
