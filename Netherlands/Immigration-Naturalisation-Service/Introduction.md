The IND (Immigration and Naturalisation Service) is a key organization for anyone looking to immigrate to the Netherlands as a Highly Skilled Migrant (HSM). Not all companies can support relocation and sponsorship; only specific companies listed by the IND can apply for your relocation package.

- **IND Sponsorship List**: [Public Register of Recognised Sponsors](https://ind.nl/en/public-register-recognised-sponsors/public-register-regular-labour-and-highly-skilled-migrants)

### Sponsorship Details

Only companies listed on the IND sponsorship list can sponsor your relocation. If your current employer is not on this list, they must partner with an enterprise service provider such as [Employor](https://www.employor.com/). These companies specialize in HR services and legal assistance to facilitate the sponsorship process.
